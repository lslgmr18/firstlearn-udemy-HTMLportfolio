<h2>My TOP 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Squid Game</h3>
<p>Amazing story with great characters, made me cry on some episodes. Overall great series, just don't watch it with your family<br /> </p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>Great character development, it showed you about the consequences of your action, "it's all good man" (it's Saul Goodman)<br /></p>
<h3>Sousou no Frieren</h3>
<p>One of the most amazing anime i've ever watch. Great story with character development, amazing scenery and artstyle, you'll love that small elf<br /></p>
